 <h1>La web del git</h1>
 <h2>Conceptual overview</h2>
 <p>The first thing to understand about git rebase is that it solves the 
    same problem as git merge. Both of these commands are designed to 
    integrate changes from one branch into 
    another branch they just do it in very different ways.</p>

  <p>Consider what happens when you start working on a new feature in a dedicated branch, 
    then another team member updates the master branch with new commits. This results in a forked history, 
    which should be familiar to anyone who has used Git as a collaboration tool.</p>
