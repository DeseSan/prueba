 <h1>La web del git</h1>
 <h2>Conceptual overview</h2>
 <p>The first thing to understand about git rebase is that it solves the 
    same problem as git merge. Both of these commands are designed to 
    integrate changes from one branch into 
    another branch they just do it in very different ways.</p>
  <a href="../paginas/rebase.html">Ramas</a>  
  <p>Consider what happens when you start working on a new feature in a dedicated branch, 
    then another team member updates the master branch with new commits. This results in a forked history, 
    which should be familiar to anyone who has used Git as a collaboration tool.</p>
    <p>Now, let's say that the new commits in master are relevant to 
        the feature that you're working on. To incorporate the new commits into your feature branch, 
        you have two options: merging or rebasing</p>
  <h2>The merge option</h2>
  <p>The easiest option is to merge the master branch into the feature branch using something like the following:
   <p> <b>git checkout feature</b></p>
   <p><b> git merge master</p></b>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>Or, you can condense this to a one-liner:</p>
<p><b>git merge master feature</p></b>
<p>This creates a new "merge commit" in the feature branch that ties 
    together the histories of both branches,
     giving you a branch structure that looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Merging is nice because it's a non-destructive operation. 
    The existing branches are not changed in any way. 
    This avoids all of the potential pitfalls of rebasing (discussed below).</p>
    <br>
<p>On the other hand, this also means that 
    the feature branch will have an extraneous merge commit every time you need
     to incorporate upstream changes. If master is very active, this can pollute your
      feature branch's history quite a bit. While it's possible to mitigate this issue 
      with advanced git log options, 
    it can make it hard for other developers to understand the history of the project.</p>
